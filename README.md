## 1️⃣ Electric Vendor Cart — Chassis & Structural Design
**Tools:** SolidWorks, Fusion 360, ANSYS  

Designed a lightweight, modular cart chassis optimized for strength, manufacturability, and ergonomics.

### 🔹 Key Highlights
- Full 3D chassis modelling with mounting interfaces  
- Static structural analysis (FOS ≥ 2.5 under 250 kg payload)  
- Achieved **12% weight reduction** through geometry optimisation  
- Designed battery housing, motor mounts, and ergonomic seating layout
