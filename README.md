## 1️⃣ Electric Vendor Cart — Chassis & Structural Design
**Tools:** SolidWorks, Fusion 360, ANSYS  

Designed a lightweight, modular cart chassis optimized for strength, manufacturability, and ergonomics.

### 🔹 Key Highlights
- Full 3D chassis modelling with mounting interfaces  
- Static structural analysis (FOS ≥ 2.5 under 250 kg payload)  
- Achieved **12% weight reduction** through geometry optimisation  
- Designed battery housing, motor mounts, and ergonomic seating layout  

## 2️⃣ SAE REEV Hybrid Electric Vehicle — Roll Cage & Suspension System
**Role:** Captain & Mechanical Lead  
**Tools:** SolidWorks, ANSYS, Lotus Suspension Analysis  

### 🔹 Contributions
- Complete roll cage design following SAE safety rules  
- Crash simulations: front, rear, side, and rollover  
- **15–20% weight reduction** while maintaining safety compliance  
- Designed double wishbone suspension (ride frequency: 1.6 Hz, optimized camber/KPI)
