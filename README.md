## 1️⃣ Electric Vendor Cart — Chassis & Structural Design  
**Tools:** SolidWorks, Fusion 360, ANSYS  

Designed a lightweight, modular cart chassis optimized for **strength, manufacturability, and ergonomics**.

### 🔹 Key Highlights
- Full 3D chassis modelling with mounting interfaces  
- Static structural analysis (FOS ≥ 2.5 under 250 kg payload)  
- Achieved **12% weight reduction** through geometry optimisation  
- Designed battery housing, motor mounts, and ergonomic seating layout

## 2️⃣ SAE REEV Hybrid Electric Vehicle — Roll Cage & Suspension Design  
**Tools:** SolidWorks, Fusion 360, ANSYS, Lotus Suspension Analysis**

Designed and analysed multiple subsystems for an SAE REEV hybrid electric vehicle, including **roll cage, suspension, and impact simulations**.

### 🔹 Key Highlights
- Designed lightweight roll cage following SAE standards  
- Performed static & crash simulation (front, side, rollover)  
- Designed double wishbone suspension (ride freq. 1.6 Hz)  
- Conducted Lotus suspension modelling for dynamics and geometry optimisation
